# character-manager-js
A Comics fan client would like to manage his favorites characters on a dashboard. He contacts us to create an app that will be able to view, edit, create all his favorites characters.

## Objectives
* Use best JS practices
* Read documentation and test a REST API
* Use a REST API with HTTP requests
* Create a typical asynchronous flow : send asynchronous (promises or async/await) requests to a remote server and process the results
* DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of HTTP requests
